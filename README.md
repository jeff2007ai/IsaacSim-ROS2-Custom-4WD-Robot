🚀 IsaacSim-ROS2-Custom-4WD-Robot
Completely Custom-Made Four-Wheel Differential Drive Robot Built from Scratch in NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.1 with ROS 2 Jazzy

## Highlights

- ✅ 100% custom-made robot
- ✅ Built from primitive cube and cylinder meshes
- ✅ Four-wheel differential drive
- ✅ ROS 2 Jazzy integration
- ✅ `/cmd_vel` control
- ✅ Camera support
- ✅ RTX LiDAR support
- ✅ Ready for SLAM Toolbox and Nav2
- ✅ No TurtleBot or URDF imports

This repository presents a **completely custom-built four-wheel differential-drive robot** designed from scratch in **NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.1** using primitive shapes (cube chassis and cylinder wheels). Unlike imported URDF models, every component, articulation, wheel joint, controller, and ROS 2 interface was manually designed and configured inside Isaac Sim.

The robot is controlled through ROS 2 `/cmd_vel` messages and serves as a foundation for perception, SLAM, navigation, and autonomous robotics applications.
